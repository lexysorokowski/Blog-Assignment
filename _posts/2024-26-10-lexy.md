The Rosary as a Catholic Christian meditative prayer form has been used for many centuries. The first version was probably written down by the Cistercian Abbot Stephen of Sallay in the thirteenth century. Carthusian monk Dominic of Prussia (died 1461) introduced the form of praying the Rosary in use today, which involves summarizing the life of Jesus in 50 final sentences (“clausulae”), in the fifteenth century. Alanus de Rupe (1428–1475) reduced this form to the 15-sentence version also in use today (von Brockhusen, 1989). From this revision, the Rosary became a prayer for the common people. Today, the 15 mysteries (sentences) are grouped into three classical sets recalling events in the lives of Jesus and Mary and are prayed on certain weekdays and seasons: the Joyful Mysteries (about the incarnation of God in Jesus), the Sorrowful Mysteries (about the Passion of Jesus) and the Glorious Mysteries (about Jesus’ resurrection) (Graber, 1976; Winston-Allen, 2005). In 2002, Pope John Paul II added another set of 5 mysteries: the Luminous Mysteries (about significant moments of Jesus’ public life) (Murphy, 2003). The Rosary cord includes 59 beads and a cross whereby each bead represents the Lord’s Prayer, Hail Mary Prayer or Glory Be Prayer, which are cited in a regular sequence. One Rosary prayer session includes five mysteries.
