The rosary is an iconic material item in the Christian religion. It is used during prayer and has significance in guiding the prayer itself. The tradition of using a rosary during prayer has been around for centuries. “In form, the rosary consists of a ritually repeated sequence of prayers accompanied by meditations on episodes in the lives of Christ and Mary.” (Mitchell, 2009). Each bead on the rosary is used for a prayer and it has been an essential element to many Christians more specifically, catholic people’s lives. I have personally owned and used a rosary so I can speak from experience that it can be very useful and meaningful in guiding prayer in an effective way. Although my experience in religious settings is minimal, the rosary was one of the first tools introduced to me. The Rosary is specifically related to Mother Mary and praying to her. The beads can be used to keep track of the “hail Mary’s” as people pray, and it ultimately helps keep track of prayer especially when it is repetitive such as Hail Mary. The Rosary is also essential to many Christians because the beads can represents different names for God and it has strong correlations with reaching heaven.
